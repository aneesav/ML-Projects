# About Me

I'm Aneesa - a Bioinformatics Scientist and PhD Dropout, turned Data Scientist in the private sector. 

I am a Data Science professional with 4+ years demonstrated proficiency in Python and R Programming, Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling/Analytics, Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization as well as strategic Stakeholder Communication. 

Owed to my long-standing experience with the rigor of academic Data Science Research, I am especially adept at critical thinking and managing project objectives end-to-end. I thrive on creative, impactful solutions, and welcome any opportunity to innovate and reason.

In this repo, you will find an end-to-end Predictive Modeling solution, including project ideation, exploratory data analysis, model build (training and testing of a handful of regressors), hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, feature importance analysis as well as model serialization for deployment to a web service.

Enjoy!
