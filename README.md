# About Me

I'm Aneesa - 

A Research Scientist with 5+ years demonstrated proficiency in Python and R Programming, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for the Biosciences. 

Owed to my intimate familiarity with the rigor of academic research, I am especially adept at critical thinking and managing project objectives end-to-end. I thrive in environments where I am empowered to think critically, and deeply about a subject matter. 

In this repo, you will find simple, foundational projects that demonstrate my core competencies including but not limited to, Data Analysis (data exploration, dimensionality reduction (PCA)), K-means Clustering, Regression, Classification, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning leveraging Neural Networks (NLP).
