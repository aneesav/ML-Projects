# About Me

I'm Aneesa - 

A Research Scientist with 5+ years demonstrated proficiency in Python and R Programming, Machine Learning and Deep Learning for the Biosciences. 

Owed to my intimate familiarity with the rigor of academic research, I am especially adept at critical thinking and managing project objectives end-to-end. I thrive in environments where I am empowered to think critically, and deeply about a subject matter. 

In this repo, you will find foundational projects that demonstrate my core competencies across supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning methods. These include but certainly are not limited to: 

* Data Analysis (data exploration, dimensionality reduction - PCA)
* K-means Clustering
* Linear Regression 
* Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Ensmeble Methods: Random Forest)
* Deep Learning (Neural Networks - NLP) 

This repo intentionally showcases simple projects, to emphasize the importance of foundational knowledge and skills. It becomes easy to solve more complex problems when you fortify your foundation, as I've illustrated here.

Enjoy.
