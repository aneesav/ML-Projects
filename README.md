# ML-Projects

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Aneesa - a Bioinformatics Scientist and PhD Dropout, turned Data Scientist in an industry setting. 

I recently withdrew from my PhD program after 2 years, due to suffering severe burnout and financial insecurity, as well as being subjected to elevated toxicity, politics and beaurocracy within the program. 

Though truncated, my stay allowed me to conduct rigorous Data Science research on murine embryonic cardiovascular development, and leverage my critical thinking skills towards developing a passion for Data Science and Machine Learning.

With this Github portfolio, I hope to curate a space for all of my own ML projects, as well as any learnings & inspiration I come across.

Hope you enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
